💼 Loan Prediction App.
A machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be Approved or Rejected based on applicant details. 
This project simulates how financial institutions can use data science to streamline decision-making and reduce loan default risks.
________________________________________
🔍 Problem Statement
Financial institutions receive numerous loan applications every day. Manually reviewing each one is time-consuming and prone to human error. 
The goal is to build a reliable model that can assist in predicting loan approval based on historical data.
